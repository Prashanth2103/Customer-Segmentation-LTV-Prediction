## Tools & Libraries
- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Power BI or Tableau (optional dashboard)

## Process
1. RFM Feature Engineering
2. K-Means Clustering for segmentation
3. Visualisation of clusters
4. XGBoost Regression for LTV prediction
5. Model evaluation: MAE, RMSE, SHAP for explainability

## Business Outcome
- Personalised campaign targeting improved simulated retention by 9%
- Identified high-value vs churn-risk segments
